\maketitle

The parallel component of the ion response tensor for ``parallel modes''
($\vec{k}\parallel\vec{B}\parallel\vec{\Omega}$) given in eq.~(71) of the
original paper is incorrect. In accordance with eq.~(49), this equation should
instead read
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\Lambda} =
  \frac{1}{2}\sum_\pm\Lambda^{}_\pm
  (\vec{e}_1\pm i\vec{e}_2)(\vec{e}_1\mp i\vec{e}_2)
  - \frac{\omega^2}{k_z^2 v_t^2} W\left(\frac{\omega}{|k_z|v_t}\right)
  \vec{e}_3\vec{e}_3.
\end{equation}
This error is inconsequential for the remainder of the paper because the
dispersion relation for parallel modes factorizes into parallel and
perpendicular branches and following eq.~(71) we only consider the
perpendicular branch.

In section~3 of the original paper we state that the labels $\perp$ and
$\parallel$ always refer to the direction of the gyro-frequency vector
$\vec{\omega}_g$ defined in eq.~(19) throughout the paper. This is in fact
only true for sections~3 and~4. In section~5, the same labels $\perp$ and
$\parallel$ instead refer to the direction of the background magnetic field
$\vec{B}$. We note, however, that the two directions are the same in the
guiding center limit considered in section~5.2 and (by definition) in the case
of parallel modes considered in section~5.3.
