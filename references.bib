  year = {2014},

  pages = {69},
  URL = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0586},
  abstract = {Black hole accretion flows can be divided into two broad classes:
  cold and hot. Cold accretion flows, which consist of cool optically thick
  gas, are found at relatively high mass accretion rates. Prominent examples
  are the standard thin disk, which occurs at a fraction of the Eddington mass
  accretion rate, and the slim disk at super-Eddington rates. These accretion
  flows are responsible for luminous systems such as active galactic nuclei
  radiating at or close to the Eddington luminosity and black hole X-ray
  binaries in the soft state. Hot accretion flows, the topic of this review,
  are virially hot and optically thin. They occur at lower mass accretion
  rates, and are described by models such as the advection-dominated accretion
  flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because of energy advection, the
  radiative efficiency of these flows is in general lower than that of a
  standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency decreases with
  decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot accretion flows
  are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments suggest that hot
  flows should produce strong winds. Hot accretion flows are believed to be
  present in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and in black hole X-ray
  binaries in the hard and quiescent states. The prototype is Sgr A*, the
  ultra-low-luminosity supermassive black hole at our Galactic center. The jet,
  wind and radiation from a supermassive black hole with a hot accretion flow
  can interact with the external interstellar medium and modify the evolution
  of the host galaxy. Details of this "maintenance-mode feedback" could, in
  principle, be worked out through theoretical studies and numerical
  simulations of hot accretion flows.}
